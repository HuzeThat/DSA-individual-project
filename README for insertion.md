Insertion Sort (C++)
A simple C++ program that implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers and measures the time it takes to sort.

Description
This program sorts a predefined array of integers using the Insertion Sort algorithm. It also calculates and displays the time taken for the sorting process, providing an insight into the performance of the sorting algorithm.

How It Works
The program initializes a vector of integers with predefined values.

It uses the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.

It measures and prints the time taken to perform the sort in seconds.

Technologies Used
C++: The core programming language used for implementing the algorithm.

ctime: The header file used for measuring the time taken by the sorting operation.

Algorithm - Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort works by iterating over the array, and for each element, inserting it into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array. This is done by shifting elements that are greater than the current element to the right and placing the current element in its correct position.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the code.

Compile the C++ code:

Output Explanation
The program sorts the array and outputs the time taken in seconds.

The time is calculated using the clock() function from the ctime library.
