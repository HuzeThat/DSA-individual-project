Selection Sort (C++)
A simple C++ program that implements the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers and measures the time it takes to sort.

Description
This program sorts a predefined array of integers using the Selection Sort algorithm. It also measures and displays the time taken for the sorting process.

How It Works
Selection Sort iterates over the array and selects the smallest element in each iteration.

It then swaps this smallest element with the element at the current position.

The program calculates the time taken for the sorting process using the clock() function and displays it.

Technologies Used
C++: Programming language used to implement the algorithm.

ctime: Header used for measuring time.

Algorithm - Selection Sort
Selection Sort works by finding the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process is repeated for the entire array until it is sorted.
