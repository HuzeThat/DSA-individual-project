Bubble Sort in C++
This program implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, which is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It sorts a given list of integers in ascending order.

Code Overview:
Functionality: The program sorts an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm and measures the time it takes to perform the sorting.

Key Components:

bubbleSort function: This sorts the vector in ascending order by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

Time Measurement: The program measures the time taken for sorting by using the clock() function to calculate the duration in seconds.

Main Program Flow:
A vector of integers is initialized.

The bubbleSort function is called to sort the array.

The time taken for the sorting operation is measured and displayed.

Usage:
Compile and run the program in any C++ environment.

Modify the array arr in main() to test the algorithm with different sets of integers.

Performance:
Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) in the worst and average case.

Space Complexity: O(1), as Bubble Sort sorts the array in-place.
